    "### Python Data Types:\n",
    "Documentation for the Python programming language (fairly dry, but specific to how these data types are implemented). This also includes links to the documentation for dictionaries, lists, and touples.\n",

    "### Python Operators:\n",
    "W3 Schools has a great set of 'cheat sheets' to review and refresh on many different languages and topics. Here is their sheet on operatiors in Python. This includes logical operations we will use in If statements to help make the computer make decisions:\n",
